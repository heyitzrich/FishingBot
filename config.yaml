detection:
  # Color mode: "red" for standard feather bobber, "blue" for lava fishing
  mode: "red"

  # HSV thresholds for RED feather detection
  # Red wraps around in HSV so we use two ranges
  red:

    upper2: [180, 255, 255]

  # HSV thresholds for BLUE feather (lava fishing)
  blue:
    lower: [100, 120, 100]
